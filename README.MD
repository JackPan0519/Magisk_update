#### This is not an officially supported Google product

## Introduction

Magisk is a suite of open source software for customizing Android, supporting devices higher than Android 5.0.<br>
Some highlight features:

- **MagiskSU**: Provide root access for applications
- **Magisk Modules**: Modify read-only partitions by installing modules
- **MagiskBoot**: The most complete tool for unpacking and repacking Android boot images
- **Zygisk**: Run code in every Android applications' processes

## Signing and Distribution

- The certificate of the key used to sign the final Magisk APK product is also directly embedded into some executables. In release builds, Magisk's root daemon will enforce this certificate check and reject and forcefully uninstall any non-matching Magisk apps to protect users from malicious and unverified Magisk APKs.
- To do any development on Magisk itself, switch to an **official debug build and reinstall Magisk** to bypass the signature check.
- To distribute your own Magisk builds signed with your own keys, set your signing configs in `config.prop`.
- Check [Google's Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#generate-key) for more details on generating your own key.

## Translation Contributions

Default string resources for the Magisk app and its stub APK are located here:

- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
- `stub/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

Translate each and place them in the respective locations (`[module]/src/main/res/values-[lang]/strings.xml`).
